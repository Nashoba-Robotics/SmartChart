As we've used SmartDashboard 2.0 (SFX) over the last year, we've found that the built-in graphing utility just isn't good enough. Seeing this, we decided to make our own version. 

####Advantages:
- Graphs based on time, instead of based on when a new data point is sent to the dashboard
- Graph can be reset
- Graph can show multiple data sets simultaneously, by sending SmartDashboard a string with the format "[num1]:[num2]:[num3]". Eg. "1.0:2.3:5.6:"

To install, download the most recent release, and move the .jar to your /sfx/plugins/ folder.
